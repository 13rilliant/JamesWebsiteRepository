            Dear Ladies and Gentleman,
        </div>
        <div class="plague paragraph_block">
                There has been a plague which has ripped through our nation. Small boys and girls everywhere
            have plummeted to the concrete ground on Halloween night for years. This epidemic level issue
            deserves to be addressed rather than met with weak-willed acceptance. It is for our small trick
            or treat friends that I present to you these crucial solutions which would protect 100% of children
            from the lurking dangers of cracked sidewalks, poor visibility, and thoughtlessness.

        <div class="plague paragraph_block">
                The culprits of the bruises and scrapes found on children across the globe: sidwalks made of concrete
            instead of cotton candy, a capitalist society which doesn't support the wide distribution of glowsticks
            to all people, and kids being too young to stand upright. If you continue on to the gallery page, you'll
            find pictures of things which are wrong, ways to improve, and other things, which I am adventerously labeling
            as relevant.
